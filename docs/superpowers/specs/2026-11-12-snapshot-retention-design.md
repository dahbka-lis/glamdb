# Explicit snapshot retention

Issue #168 requires an opt-in maintenance operation that bounds retained root
history while preserving every append receipt and all current data.

The public C++ facade exposes `ExpireSnapshots` with an optional policy. An
omitted policy uses the policy already persisted in the current Iceberg root;
an empty policy retains everything. `keep_last` protects at least that many
snapshots, and `min_age` protects younger snapshots. Their union is retained,
including the current snapshot. Only an oldest contiguous prefix can expire.
Maintenance is explicit; applications choose when to invoke it.

## Approaches

Silently expiring during append changes existing admission and retry semantics.
Keeping every old manifest list in a side history does not reclaim metadata.
The selected approach publishes maintenance separately through the existing
outer SQLite authority, with a durable expiration ledger and cleanup queue.

Catalog version 3 is created lazily on the first maintenance publication.
Versions 1 and 2 remain unchanged until opt-in. Expiration records bind opaque
snapshot IDs to their original sequence and operation receipt. Recovery verifies
the retained suffix and all current manifests against the permanent receipts,
without reading expired manifest lists. The current root carries only a sequence
watermark and the retained suffix; snapshot IDs are never compared numerically.

Cleanup follows confirmed publication, waits for collection metadata planners,
unlinks only ledgered metadata and synchronizes the directory before acknowledging
the queue. Interrupted cleanup resumes after authoritative recovery. Current
manifests and Parquet files remain referenced and are never removed. Already
planned cursors continue reading their immutable membership and data; new reads
and preconditions on expired IDs return `SNAPSHOT_EXPIRED`.

The default operation capacity remains 4,096. An explicitly larger finite
operation profile (up to 8,192) reserves additional catalog/recovery memory;
retention-enabled collections can retain up to 16,384 current manifests. Data,
catalog bytes and manifest bytes remain bounded; expiration is not compaction.
No HTTP/SDK/UI maintenance interface is added in this change.

## Invariants and evidence

The current snapshot, schema, table identity, data membership and receipts never
change during maintenance. Exact-base CAS and durable root verification precede
the outer COMMIT. Uncertain COMMIT closes readiness until reconciliation. Failed
or interrupted maintenance cannot authorize file deletion. Tests cover default
compatibility, policy unions, expired errors, cursor lifetime, receipt replay,
reopen, corruption, publication faults, resumable cleanup and a >4,096 campaign.
Process crashes and simulated faults do not qualify physical power loss.
