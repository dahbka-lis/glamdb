# Verified scan membership

The local backend derives scan membership during strict Iceberg closure
verification. Iceberg roots, manifest lists and manifests remain authoritative;
there is no persisted auxiliary index or storage migration.

Each immutable `TBaseState` binds the exact metadata location, parsed root,
verified usage and a `TScanMembership`. The index stores each data-file
descriptor once in chronological order. A sorted snapshot-ID table identifies
each retained snapshot's prefix boundary. IDs are opaque; sorting IDs is only
for lookup. Scanning reverses the selected prefix to preserve the manifest
order produced by fast append. Initial-empty views select zero files.

This works only for the current append-only, unpartitioned, fixed-schema
profile. Deletes, branches, compaction, snapshot expiration and schema evolution
need a different representation and validation contract.

## Verification and lifetime

`CheckManifest` records a descriptor only after the existing strict manifest
entry/counter/path checks and Parquet length, row-count, schema and field-ID
verification succeed. Recovery builds one index while verifying every retained
transition. Publication copies the verified base index and checks only the new
closure; that candidate remains tentative until the outer SQLite commit.

- Confirmed publication installs the exact candidate.
- Definite rollback discards the candidate and retains the previous index.
- Uncertainty, observed corruption and reconciliation invalidate backend admission.
- A failed rebuild leaves no usable backend generation. Successful recovery
  rebuilds from authoritative files and the engine completes its durability fence.

The engine caches the index with its confirmed collection view. A scan pins both
under the same state lock, including the interval between backend confirmation
and engine-view refresh. Later appends cannot change its files or selected view.
The cursor retains its FileIO and store lease; returned buffers retain the lease.
New scans are blocked while recovery is required. Existing pinned cursors retain
their immutable membership and normal data-read/error behavior.

Healthy `Engine::Scan` planning performs no root, manifest-list or manifest I/O.
It selects a boundary in O(log retained snapshots), without copying the file
prefix. `limit=0` opens no data file. Data-file footer and decoded-value checks
still run during execution. Cursor `manifests_read` is measured zero for indexed
scans. The uncached planner remains available for custom backends and component
tests. Metadata/history/file-detail APIs still read authoritative metadata;
neither cached planning nor recovery is a full data-page scrub.

## Cost and reproduction

The current development caps bound snapshots and files. They do not impose a
shared memory quota. A live generation takes O(files + snapshots) index space;
publication copies that space, and cursors may retain previous generations.
Recovery adds descriptors to one mutable builder before publishing it. See
[resource budgets](RESOURCE_BUDGETS.md) for the remaining aggregate reservations.

Build and run the native benchmark:

```sh
cmake --build --preset release --target glamdb_scan_index_bench --parallel 2
build/release/tests/glamdb_scan_index_bench 32 1000
build/release/tests/glamdb_scan_index_bench 128 1000
build/release/tests/glamdb_scan_index_bench 256 1000
```

Each run creates a disposable native store with duplicate/NULL rows, compares
indexed and uncached planning, counts metadata opens, then closes and reopens
the engine. Reopen is cold with respect to engine state; the OS page cache is
not flushed. `index_capacity_bytes` counts the index object and retained vector
and path-string capacities, excluding allocator rounding, shared-pointer control
blocks, parsed roots/manifests, FileIO instrumentation and process RSS.

Measured on 2026-11-12 with Linux x86-64, Clang 18 and a Release build using
the pinned native dependencies. Timings are observations on a shared host,
not latency guarantees. Each warm scan measurement contains 1,000 zero-limit
scan opens; each uncached planning measurement contains five full membership
plans. Counts include every metadata `OpenRead` through the injected native FS.

| Appends | Indexed plan, us | Uncached plan, ms | Warm scan, us | Warm metadata opens | Uncached metadata opens / plan | Reopen, ms | Rebuilt index capacity, bytes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 32 | 0.166 | 25.7 | 3.62 | 0 | 68 | 83.7 | 7,984 |
| 128 | 0.127 | 115.0 | 4.54 | 0 | 260 | 235.0 | 31,792 |
| 256 | 0.130 | 234.9 | 7.60 | 0 | 516 | 513.7 | 63,536 |

Reopen performs authoritative metadata reads (259 / 1,027 / 2,051 respectively)
and reconstructs membership. The benchmark does not establish device-cold
latency, total recovery RAM, a process memory cap or power-loss qualification.

`ScanIndexTest` compares indexed and uncached native membership and literal
duplicate/NULL rows for latest, historical and initial-empty selectors, keeps
orphans invisible, and checks rebuild/invalidation. `BackendPublicationTest`
checks tentative/confirmed, rollback, uncertainty and failed-rebuild transitions.
`BackendPublicationIntegration` exercises publication handoff and lost COMMIT
results with real SQLite/Parquet/Iceberg. The existing uncached `ScanMockTest`
suite uses in-memory FileIO and remains separate evidence.

## Executed checks

On official base `1f48601`, the Release build and native CTest pass with 627
discovered cases (one disabled benchmark and two child-only skips). ASan/UBSan
pass 110 scan/mock cases and the 155-case storage suite (one child-only skip in
each); 18 storage-disabled checks include the installed consumer. Leak detection
is disabled in the sandbox; pinned dependencies use their ordinary builds.

LLVM 18 formatting covers 196 files; static analysis covers 121 translation
units. One new upstream admission file was rechecked after its build metadata
became available. Formatting/analyzer negative checks pass. An independent
critical review found no issues, including a follow-up against the updated base.

The existing `SerializationIsLinearInRetainedSnapshots` timing check initially
reported a 3.20 ratio during concurrent builds/analysis (limit 3.0). The complete
storage suite passed when rerun without that load; the ratio was 2.17.
